## Full License Terms

In the interest of accessibility these licensing terms are provided in plain, clear English, using an FAQ format. Anyone creating content that is licensed under a Creative Comrades License Agreement (CCLA 1.0) agrees to the following terms.

If you do anything that goes against this agreement, you will be in violation of the license. If you are in violation of the license, the Artist may, at their own discretion, issue a takedown notice and invoice the Community Creator for unlicensed usage.

## Who are you?

If you created the work to be licensed, you are the **Artist**.

If you are using the work created and licensed by the Artist within your own creations, you are the **Community Creator**.

## FAQ

### What kind of work can be licensed under CCLA 1.0?

Art, music, film, writing, games, etc. The only restriction is it must be a replicable creative work. It cannot be a service or ephemeral work, such as an unrecorded performance.

### I want to use the work licensed under CCLA 1.0; can I sell what I make for money?

You own wholly, any new or novel contributions you make using work licensed under CCLA 1.0, and may sell or distribute it however you wish as long as it does not violate any of the exclusions or restrictions in the agreement.

### Does this license exclude any specific kinds of works?

Plain reproduction of the work is not covered under this agreement. What this means, for example, is you cannot just put licensed artwork on merchandise or reproduce unmodified written works in a different format or medium, and sell it.

You cannot use the work in any form or version of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). You also cannot use the work in any other type of blockchain reliant product.

You cannot transfer usage rights to other entities.

Otherwise everything else is fair game. Games, books, animations, etc. Contact the Artist if you are unsure if your project qualifies, or if you want additional usage rights that this agreement does not cover.

### What are my obligations under this agreement?

If you are the Artist, you must clearly label work licensed under CCLA as such. Use the compact, short, or full license labels below – replacing **ArtistName** with your name as you wish to be referenced. You can optionally substitute the term "work" in these templates with more specific terms, such as "art," "writing," "music," etc. You can also optionally apply hyperlinks to your your website and/or creativecomrades.org:

"Work by **ArtistName** CCLA 1.0"

"Work by ” is licensed under CCLA 1.0"

"This work by **ArtistName** is licensed under the Creative Comrades License Agreement 1.0"

If you are the Community Creator, you must use the CCLA label created by the artist within your project — plainly visible and easily readable.

### What work by an Artist is available under the CCLA agreement?

Work tagged by an Artist with a CCLA 1.0 license label (see above for examples) is available for use under a CCLA 1.0.

Artists may host their work via whatever medium and platform they chose, as long as the medium and/or platform are not an NFT and/or a blockchain reliant platform.

The Artist reserves the right to remove artwork from availability at any time for any reason. Removal of a piece of art from availability only impacts new uses of that art from that day forward. Existing and in-progress projects and products using removed art are still covered under the original agreement. This flexibility on the Artist’s behalf is in place to allow flexibility for situations such as artistic subjects who no longer wish their likeness to be widely available for use, limiting access to content an Artist or audience deems to be inappropriate for further use, etc.

### Does this agreement have any restrictions based on content?

Yes. You cannot use work licensed under CCLA 1.0 in any any context that would generally be deemed bigoted or hateful towards minorities, marginalized identities, and/or oppressed classes of any kind. You can use work licensed under CCLA 1.0 in any context that critiques bigotry, fascism, TERFs, billionaires, white supremacy, and other oppressive forces.

You cannot say or imply that your work is in any way affiliated with the Artist unless you have an augmented agreement with the Artist to do so. You cannot promote your project in a way that might confuse or mislead people into thinking the work licensed under CCLA 1.0 was created by someone besides the Artist. And to emphasize this again: You cannot use work licensed under CCLA 1.0 to create anything related to cryptocurrency or NFTs.

### Do my works have to be released under this same license agreement?

No. You may of course replicate this agreement for your own work, but you’re under no obligation to do so. Note that any of the work you acquired as part of this agreement remains covered under this agreement regardless of how you distribute your own ideas.

### Corpo Clause

The above agreement does not apply to any commercial entity, corporate or otherwise, with more than $1,000,000 USD in gross revenue within any one of the previous three tax years. Any such entity should contact the Artist to discuss licensing options.

This revenue amount was chosen as a point at which a commercial entity unquestionably has the financial capital available to pay the creators of the work they use.

### Can this agreement be augmented or restricted further?

The rights granted by the CCLA 1.0 can be augmented by the Artist, but they cannot be restricted further.
You can craft your own license using language from the CCLA 1.0 as long as the new license does not use the Creative Comrades License Agreement name.

### What changes to the CCLA can be made by its stewards?

This agreement allows the stewards of the CCLA to edit, add, and/or remove text without it being considered a new version of the contract, so long as the revisions are for the purpose of correcting typos, clarifying unclear language, and/or improving the enforceability of the terms. Any changes to the agreement that expand or reduce the rights granted, or otherwise materially change the intent and usability of the license agreement, require a new iterative version be published — to be noted by incrementing the version number. Dot updates (such as 1.0 to 1.1) indicate minor revisions, while full integer updates (such as 1.1 to 2.0) indicate major revisions.

### What about the public domain?

In any and all cases where the public domain grants rights greater than this agreement, the CCLA 1.0 yields to the more accessible terms of the public domain. In any and all cases where this agreement grants rights greater than the public domain, the terms of the CCLA 1.0 supersede the terms of the public domain.
