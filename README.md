## About

An unofficial FoundryVTT compendium of rolltables and macros for [VOID 1680 AM](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io/void-1680-am) by [Ken Lowery](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io).

[VOID 1680 AM](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io/void-1680-am) can also be found at the following links:

* [Drive Thru RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/429839/void-1680-am)

## Features and Notes

* [VOID 1680 AM](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io/void-1680-am) is a single-player tabletop roleplaying game. In it, you will take on the persona of a radio broadcaster and use tools of chance to build your playlist and sketch out the identities and concerns of people who call in to talk to you.
* The FoundryVTT module includes roll tables and macros for the tables in the RPG.
* Includes the *Voices in the Void* expansion.
* The resources are presented as compendiums in a module instead of a complete RPG system. The compendiums can be pulled into any system as desired.
  * The [Simple World-Building system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/worldbuilding) can serve as a default, if needed.
