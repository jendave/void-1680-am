## About

A FoundryVTT compendium of rolltables and macros for [VOID 1680 AM](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io/void-1680-am) by [Ken Lowery](https://bannerlessgames.itch.io).

## Features and Notes

* VOID 1680 AM is a single-player tabletop roleplaying game. In it, you will take on the persona of a radio broadcaster and use tools of chance to build your playlist and sketch out the identities and concerns of people who call in to talk to you.
* The FoundryVTT module includes roll tables and macros for the tables in the RPG.
* The resources are presented as compendiums in a module instead of a complete RPG system. The compendiums can be pulled into any system as desired.
